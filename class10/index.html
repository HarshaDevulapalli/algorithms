#Algorithms: How I Learned to Embrace Randomness
##Richard Dunks, Instructor
###Follow along: http://bit.ly/algo2016-class10

---

# Do Now
+ Build a simple decision tree classifier
+ Use the data in the `winequality` table
+ There's an outline in `class10/donow/`
+ .red[Make a copy of the notebook]

---

# Goals
+ Review homework on creating your own cross validation function
+ Introduce Bayesian models
+ Introduce random forests
+ Discuss vectorization

---

# Assignment 1
+ Use the pseudocode you came up with in class to write your own 5-fold cross-validation function that splits the data set into 5 equal-sized sets
+ Don't forget to shuffle the input before assigning to sets
+ You can use the `fit()`, `predict()`, and `score()` functions of your model in your functions
+ Test the results with the sklearn `cross_val_score`
+ In your PR, discuss what challenges you had creating this function and if it helped you better understand cross validation

# Theses slides are based on the slides by 
+ Tan, Steinbach and Kumar (textbook authors)

# Conditional Probability
![img-right-50](../images/cp1a.png)

+ `H` is having a headache
+ `F` is coming down with the flu
--

+ P(H) = 1/10
--

+ P(F) = 1/40
--

+ P(H|F) = 1/2
--

## “Headaches are rare and flu is rarer, but if you’re coming down with the flu there’s a 50-50 chance you’ll have a headache.”

---

# Conditional Probability
+ P(A|B) = Fraction of worlds in which B is true that also have A true
+ Read it as "The probability of B given A"

# Assigned Readings (class 9)
+ "Random Forests" in Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
+ "Naive Bayes" in Doing Data Science

# Optional Readings
+ [scikit-learn documentation on cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)
+ ["Random forests in Python"](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/random-forests-in-python.html)

---

# Assignment 2 (Class 9)
+ Using the readings, try and create a `RandomForestClassifier` for the iris dataset
+ Using a 75/25 training/test split, compare the results with the original decision tree model and describe the result to the best of your ability in your PR

---

# Assignment 3 (Class 9)
+ Review the code in `homework/bill_classifier.ipynb`
+ Understand the steps in creating a text classifier
+ Comment in your PR on the utility of something like this for the work you've done or would like to do



---

# Assignment 1
+ Review Classification in the wild
